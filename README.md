<h2> About The Horiseon Code Refactoring Project</h2>
-> Hereâ€™s the enhanced version of your text:  

Refactoring is an integral part of a Software Engineer's responsibilities, making this project a valuable opportunity to practice real-world skills.  
- **HTML and CSS Optimization**: The codebase was refactored to reduce redundancy and adhere to the D.R.Y (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, ensuring cleaner and more maintainable code.  <hr>
- **Feature Enhancement 1**: A "Back to Top" button was implemented at the bottom of the page, improving user navigation and overall experience. <hr>
- **Feature Enhancement 2**: Each image now includes a link to a relevant educational YouTube video, adding an interactive and informative element to the design.  

Let me know if you'd like further refinements!
